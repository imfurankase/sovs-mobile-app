1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:

That's it! You'll get a URL like `https://your-project.vercel.app`

## 🔄 Rebuilding After Changes

When you make changes to your app, rebuild and redeploy:

```bash
npm run build:web
vercel --prod dist  # or netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```
